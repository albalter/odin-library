add a New Book button that allows the user to input the details for a new book and 
add it to the library. I'd like to do it with the <dialog> tag and modals.
We will also need to use event.preventDefault(); to keep the form from being 
submitted to the server

deletion -- add button on each book display to remove the book from the library. To associate the 
display DOM object with the books in the data pipeline, on way is to five them data-
attribute that corresponds to the UID of the respective book object.
 
mark as read -- Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status. To facilitate this you 
will want to create Book prototype function that toggles a book instance’s read status.

Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page. 
You can display them in some sort of table, or each on their own “card”. It might 
help for now to manually add a few books to your array so you can see the display.
While it might look easier to manipulate the display of the books directly rather 
than store their data in an array first, from here forward, you should think of 
these responsibilities separately.

    loop through the elements in library. As long as there is a book there, create a 
    "library card" div that will include the book data and buttons to mark as read
    (change the backend representation) and to delete the record (see corresponding
    ticket in the issue tracker)
